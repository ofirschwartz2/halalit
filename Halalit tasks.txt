Current work:
Issues:
- Make ALL halalit attacks variants of Halalit attack

In Proggress:
- Merge

Fixed:
- The sword is too small - when changed it's not really attacking
- Cannot load new instance of the same attack
- All attacks should be instantiated in projectiles
- Knockback shot doesn't do any knockback
- Bommerangs are not dying when they come back to the halalit
- Some weapons (sword or knockback wave) are not really descrete or consecutive harmers, they need something else 
- Fix laser...
- Make sword to load the AttackBehaviour
